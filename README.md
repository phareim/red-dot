# Vibe Coding a Game

## Instructions (so far)

Use the arrow keys to move the red dot around the screen.

you can play for points, or play forever. 

i wrote the thing, and i'm unsure what the best strategy is. 

four of the same colour starts a chain reaction that creates a lot of points. but the longer the tail, the more points. 

there should be some kind of time extension as well...
